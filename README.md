# The compiler mod branch

## Overview

[JamieBuilds](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler) developed a wonderfully educative compiler example a few years ago in Javascript, and this is a 250 line python implementation. It's the code for [this](https://youtu.be/jeOU6KJFi8c) live Battle Royale game show hosted by Siraj Raval on Youtube. It takes an input expression in LISP and converts it into C.

## Dependencies

- copy
- re

## Usage

Type 'python compiler.py' into a command line to run this code. You can switch out the input expression in the main function with your own to test out different outputs.
